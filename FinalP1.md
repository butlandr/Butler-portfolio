# Final Part I
## Outline and Initial Sketches

## Data

I have been collected and compiling data from several different public sources within a google sheet. Below is a view only link:

## Method and Medium

For this presentation I will use a Shorthand story progression as it will provide the most emotional/artistic way to present a series of images which I have always found much more capable of providing information than any other means. My plan is to use imagery, satire, and low tech terminology to explain some high level concepts with the ultimate goal of reducing or eliminating any perceived fears of radiation dangers cause by previous world events. 

This may be too ambitious, but the ultimate goal of my presentation would be to produce an interactive infographic that would allow a person to select a particular negative health effect of radiation exposure and then present them with a image or chart that would show how much exposure is required to achieve this negative effect and how many times one would have to partake in a particular activity to reach that (such as eating bananas, taking flights, or going to the doctor).
