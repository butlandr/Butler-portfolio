# About me
I'm Andrew Butler (he) and I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I am in the MPM program, looking to complete this fall. I moved here for work from Seattle last fall but grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin. I like excercise, movies, cooking, and dogs.

I have a background and degree in Mechancical Engineerning and I am an active duty military officer stationed at CMU as an Assistant Professor in the Naval Science Department. I teach Naval Engineering and Weapons systems to undergrads and I staff CMU's NROTC command. In the Navy I work as a qualified Submarine Officer and a certified Naval Nuclear Engineer.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn some new techniques and strategies for data presentation as well as improve my computer skills, getting some basic literacy in some of the different programs available publicly will also give me a "toolbox" I can utilize in any future endeavors.
