# About me
I'm Andrew Butler (he) and I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I am in the MPM program, looking to complete this fall.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn some new techniques and strategies for data presentation as well as improve my computer skills, getting some basic literacy in some of the different programs available publicly will also give me a "toolbox" I can utilize in any future endeavors.
